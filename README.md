#A SMF 2.0 forum for the godot community.

There is currently a test instance online:

#[Godotdevelopers.org](http://www.godotdevelopers.org)

The forum is based on the SMF 2.0 forum system.

On that githubpage you only hava acces to the Theme (Themes are very powerful in SMF. They include not only the style but also have acces to almost every php behaviour)
So this theme Includes a featured project bar and some other features in addition to a nice layout.
You should try out the link to test the them. 
It is based on another Theme called ALDO. I forther developed it to fit the needs for a game engine Forum.
Take a look at this thread in the actual fourum there i also explain how to use the Feature project bar which will immidiatly work when you install the theme on an instance of SMF.

How to install the Theme:
 - Donload SMF and copy it on a server.
 - use the install.php file to install SMF and create the Database.
 - go inside the Themes directory and copy the aldo folder in there.
 - Now you need to log in with your admin account and choose the aldo theme you just pasted into the folder.
 - If you really want you also can install the smilie package which is the same than this one: ![flatEmojii](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=4049) but there is also a godot smilie
 - Now everything should work.

###List of settings (SMF) which should be changed when setting up a new SMF page with that theme:
 - profil/avatar image size: 100px, 100px
 - image upload file size is very small and needs to be increast (you should at least be able to uploat 720p images)
 - Max width of posted pictures should be set to:    width: 720 (otherwise there will be scrollbars.
